# Quantitative Finance Projects Repository

Welcome to my **Quantitative Finance (Quant) Projects** repository! ðŸ“ˆðŸ’° This repository contains a collection of **financial modeling and quantitative finance projects**, implemented using **Python**. The goal is to explore different mathematical models, risk management techniques, and portfolio optimization strategies.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
- **Notebooks (.ipynb)**: Each notebook presents a self-contained project focused on a specific financial model or strategy.
- **DATA Folder**: This folder includes **CSV files and datasets** used in these projects for simulations and backtesting.

## ðŸ“Œ Projects Included
### ðŸ“Š Financial Models & Simulations
- **Black-Litterman Model**: A Bayesian approach to portfolio optimization, incorporating investor views.
- **GARCH Model**: A volatility modeling technique used in risk management and financial forecasting.
- **Monte Carlo Simulation for Asian Options**: A stochastic simulation method for pricing Asian options.
- **Smart Beta Portfolio**: A quantitative investment strategy combining factor-based investing with passive index strategies.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
